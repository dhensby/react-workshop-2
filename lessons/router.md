##Â React Router exercises

React Router is the best framework for adding routing to React apps.

The best place to find documentation on this is at: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/

(PS: the middle exercises and the redux ones all used React Router! Feel free to go back at a later point and look at the code).

The basic premise of RRv4 is that you wrap your application in a `<BrowserRouter>` component. Then, within there, at any point, you can render `<Route>` components which are then rendered if the path they are given matches the current URL.

Run `npm run react-router-exercises` to get the example started.

Look through the code in `App.js`. Note that we wrap most of (but not our entire app) in a `<Router>`. Anything not within a `<Route>` component will always be rendered, so that's the best place to put things like headers, navigation, and so on.

Routes can have a property `exact`, which means they only render when the URL matches their `path` property exactly. If they don't have this property, it will match even if it's a partial URL match - eg a path `/foo` would match the URL of `/foo/bar`.

Routes take a component to render.

You'll notice we have two pages, `Home` and `All Posts`. Add a third, `About`, and render a component. It should be present at the `/about` URL.

Next up, using the skills you've learned earlier, go to the `Posts` component, and update it so it renders a list of all the posts from our dummy API.

Next, go to `SinglePost.js` and make it render a single post from the API based on the ID in the URL.

Finally, can you have a list of all posts, and make it so when you click one it shows below? So at all times you should be able to see a list of posts, and then click one to make it visible. Tip: You'll want to make the Routes not have the `exact` property, so they both render when the URL is `/posts/:id`.

Last up: talk about `Switch` to render 404s. Move the nested posts/:id into the Posts component.
