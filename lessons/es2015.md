# ES2015

Before we dive into more React we're going to take a quick detour into ES2015.

We won't use too many new features but there's a few that we should cover that are used a lot in React.

Change directory into the `es2015-exercises` folder and load it up in your editor.

You can read the code and play with it and run them via `npm`:

- `npm run arrow-funcs`
- `npm run classes`
- `npm run objects`
